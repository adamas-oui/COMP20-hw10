	<h1>Google Geocoing API</h1>
  <p>The API I chose to practice with is Google's Geocoding API from Google Maps Platform. 
    Geocoding converts address into geographic coordinates. I used their API with their 
    given example which returns a JSON format of latitude and longitude of "1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA".
    Basically, this can be used when I have any addresses I want to convert it to geo-info for the sake 
    of georesolution, geotagging, or geovisualization. 
  </p>
  <h3>https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start</h3>
  <h2>Options for API Request</h2>
  <p>I used XMLHttpRequest to accomplish the API request. It is a built-in object 
     and part of the vanilla Javascript. I first called the XMLHttpRequest constructor 
     using the 'new' keyword and stored the result in a variable called 'request'.
    Then I called the open() function which contains three parameters: GET method,
    the URL of API, and a boolean value of loading preference. I then set the 
    onreadystatechange property and add the send() function to send the request to the URL I called.</p>
  <p>Application 1: Any applications that involve satellite mapping and location-tracking, such as package/food delivery.</p>
  <p>Application 2: Researches about residency of citizens, such as a geospatial investigation of 
     the relationship between the housing locations of COVID patients and their communities.</p>
